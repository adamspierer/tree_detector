Using a particle detector to locate yellow trees in the Amazon

This repo was created for a Brown University graduate level seminar course on Computational Analysis of Spatial Data in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The notebook documents my attempt to apply a particle detection algorithm to locate yellow trees from a forest of green trees in the Amazon, using LiDAR data collected from orbital sensors. 

The results demonstrate that a particle detector can be used to locate these trees, though optimization of the detection parameters are necessary to exclude geological features like rivers. 

The original file is too large to host on GitHub, but lower resolution versions are displayed in the notebook.
